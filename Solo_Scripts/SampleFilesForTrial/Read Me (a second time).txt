Read Me (a second time):

labels=contours
the files supplied are set up around the idea that this is the fish that you will be testing.

Still, here are some parameters in the event that this file is over-written:
*framefreq=3
*extension_length_head=5;
*extension_length_tail=10;
*SegmentNum or NumOfSegs=5 (the fish model I supplied was the 5 segment one)
*fishlength=109 millimetres (10.9cm when running the final script, as its units take in cm)
*fish_mass_g=7.5
*fish half width= (1/24)*fishlength
*fish half height= (1/17.8)*fishlength

Once again, thanks to Roboflow (cited in previous ReadMe) for providing a nice interface to manipulate SAM from.
